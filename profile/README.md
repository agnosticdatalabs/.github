# Welcome!

Speed up your delivery with modern, agnostic metadata management and data solution automation.

Agnostic Data Labs (ADL) is a data solution automation platform and service provider for Data Management teams looking for an open and agnostic approach to managing data assets and processes in an organisation.

With ADL, you can create data solutions based on various forms for Ensemble Models (Data Vault, Anchor etc.), Dimensional Models and / or data lake approaches.

A number of starter architectures (solutions) are provided out of the box to showcase how certain approaches can be implemented, and to use these foundations to developer your own data solution.

We have taken great care to make ADL flexible and extensible. This is because we strongly believe data solutions need to evolve to make the most out of changing technology, progressive understanding of the methodologies used, and -last but certainly not least- the direction the business is heading.

With ADL, there is no vendor lock-in, no forced opinions on how to implement methodologies (‘non-opinionated’).

Everything is open, visible and template-based.

Designers and developers are free to change certain conventions, approaches and implementation choices to suit the project’s needs, or to evolve with the progressive understanding of the data, the modelling approach used, and the technology on which the data solution is built.

ADL natively integrates with GIT, so all changes in the design are tracked and visible for all developers as part of the project’s Git workflow. This approach can facilitate large and decentralised teams to collaborate on a single enterprise-level data warehouse.
